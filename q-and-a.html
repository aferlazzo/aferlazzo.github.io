    Welcome, visitor,
    
    There isn't much to look at (I just love playing Mr. Modest) because I'm setting this up 
    as I'm job hunting. This is just a simple website to display some information about me.
    No, it doesn't have a lot of JavaScript that I can dazzle you with. No, there's no reason
    to make it an Angular SPA. It's just here to make visitors feel good by seeing that I can 
    code. As things change I'll continue to evolve these comments. 
    
    I'm using Bootstrap to simplify making this site responsive.

                <p class="my-answer">
                    My BFFs are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I've been successful with both large and
                    small companies. I've also written Chrome Extensions as required, have dabbled with
                    canvas, have utilized sprites and compressed images as deemed appropriate. I've
                    gzipped and minimized. I've learned hacks to circumvent browser limitations.<br>
                    I've banished the use of IE from less than 1,000 yards from my laptop. I've used
                    WiFi to escape from the clutches of Cat-5 cabling. I've converted from the almighty
                    binary system to hexadecimal to octal to decimal system, but I've not been caught up
                    for too long in any religion or cult. I'm sold on Agile although there are quite a few
                    splinter groups. I'm love the smell of team spirit, and know about healthy competition.
                    Always learning and absorbing the new, but not forsaking the old because I know 
                    current technology is built on the best of the past, just as the mighty terabyte must 
                    consider the lowly bit, even with checksums and such.

                    I've designed, depicted, and destroyed many a web page over the years. My experience 
                    with designers has been good. I'd rather have a mock-up or wire-frame than a blank 
                    page. I liken it to a web page version of having a painting-by-the-numbers of a Monet.

                    I struggle with stopping work. I love this stuff, but sometimes when debugging I 
                    need to be able to take a break from a vexing problem! I've never been a quitter. 
                    It just goes against my nature.

                    Finding a hair growing out of the side of my mashed potatoes bothers me big-time.
                    People living in poverty, greed, and senseless wars and bother me. But besides that, 
                    missing semicolons at the end of JavaScript statements, non-indented code, forgetting 
                    to include "use strict" statements,css rules all on one line, using closing tag syntax
                    (... /&gt;) with HTML5. Why do those things bother me? Because they are wrong.

                    I approach it from the left after swinging by the coffee machine. It's not in my 
                    nature to begin by recalling where I left off from the day before. I don't have a way 
                    to turn it off and back on, so I'm often working on issues in my head after I leave
                    work and making plans for getting back at it.

                    magazines and journals, but nowadays I read about stuff online. Plus I talk to other

                    Keeping my skills current and not spreading myself too thin. That's why I've kept 
                    coming back to working on the front-end of websites. It's good to be well-rounded 
                    and understand the big picture and all the technologies involved in delivering 
                    solutions to customers, but no one has a deep understanding of all technologies
                    involved with an end-to-end solution. I'm also passionate about doing the best 
                    possible job I can. If it's worth doing it is worth doing right.
